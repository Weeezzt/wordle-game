                        Wordle was born out of a love for words and puzzles. The idea was to create a game that
                        challenges the mind, yet is simple and fun to play. The goal of Wordle is not just to guess a
                        word, but to do so with a limited number of attempts. This adds a layer of strategy and
                        thoughtfulness to the game. Every guess becomes a clue, every letter a potential step towards
                        victory. It's a game that celebrates the beauty and complexity of language, and we hope it
                        brings you as much joy to play as it brought us to create.
